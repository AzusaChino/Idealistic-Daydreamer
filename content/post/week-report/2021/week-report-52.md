Cold week indeed, which causes little effort input on learning, sad.

## Read

I will gradually switch to physical books instead of digital ones. Reading online was quite convenient, but that convenience also made me didn't pay much attention to the book, and most importantly, I began to care quality more than quantity.

### Feynman Technique

Even though I only read the preface, I should remember the `Five steps of Feynman Technique`:

- Identify the topic you want to learn
- Explain the topic as if teaching a sixth-grader
- Identify areas of improvement in your explanation
- Improve and optimize your explanation
- Repeat the steps until you've achieved mastery of the topic

Hope to finish this book before 2022.

## Learn

### Git commit rules

Learned the rules of git committing, you don't have to tag out every commit, but you have to explain your commit well, with extra detailed information better.

```sh
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

More detailed explanatory text

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789
```

### Basic Cargo usage

Read the official book of cargo, understand the basics of cargo.

```toml

## Life

My Christmas gift was `Joy-Con` (from myself). Pretty good stuff, by exercising indoors, I could warm up myself from the icy days.

## Thought

### From 五分选手

- 生活，本就是一场渡劫，过程难免窘迫狼狈，但作为一个成年人，不管身上流血流汗，只要不下场，哪怕遇到大灾大难，未来一切皆有可能。
- 懒等于穷，就是这么直接。20 不勤，30 不立，40 不富，50 而衰靠子助。「父母给的叫背景，自己打的叫江山，不要假装很努力，结果不会陪你一起演戏。」
- 人生有两种苦，一种苦是自律的苦，一种苦是后悔的苦。自律的苦轻如鸿毛，后悔的苦重如泰山。
- 人与人之间的竞争表面上是车子房子面子。核心是能力资源人脉！本质是认知思维价值人品！
- 不要着急，一定不要放弃！繁花锦簇，硕果累累，需要过程。

### From myself

You don't have to live too long, except you don't need to live with your mortal body.
