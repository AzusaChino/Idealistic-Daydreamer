## Remember the 80-20 rule

## Consider using lazy evaluation

## Amortize the cost of expected computations

## Understand the origin of temporary objects

## Facilitate the return value optimization

## Overload to avoid implicit type conversion

## Consider using `op=` instead of stand-alone `op`

## Consider alternative libraries

## Understand the costs of virtual functions, multiple inheritance, virtual base classes and RTTI
